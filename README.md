Let me know if any other little things are needed.  I believe at this point we just need the real content, so:
 - Need to swap the images/svgs in the Publish and Run sections with some that work in all browsers (Safari is currently fine)
 - Need to swap all the Lorem Ipsum
 - Need an image for the video prompt (currently a cheeseburger)
 - Need to swap to the actual video (currently a song from Centaurworld)

All the other images and links, such as social, have been manually checked. They are things we use in other projects and seem fine.
